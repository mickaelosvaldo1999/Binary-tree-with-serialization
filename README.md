# Binary-tree-with-serialization
This repository contains the implementation of a B-Tree data structure in c++ for data serialization in a binary file. 
B-Tree is a important secondary memory search data structure that enables efficient retrieval of data stored on disk.Data serialization in a binary file is a process of converting data into a format that can be stored on disk efficiently and retrieved later. This is especially important for large amounts of data that cannot be held in main memory.

#Features
Binary search for integers
Version controller for future updates
Linux friendly
Data stored in a binary file (not recomended for WEB requests, you can use my Json converter in: https://github.com/mickaelosvaldo1999/JsonCreator)

#How to use?
Clone this repository to your machine
Import the btree module in your code
Create an instance of the B-Tree with btree.BTree()
Insert data into the B-Tree with the insert(key, data) method
Retrieve data from the B-Tree with the search(key) method
